# RenderingEngine
A cross-plattform, multi-implementation rendering engine.

Currently working on OpenGL.


## TODO
- 1. Make context class for graphics contexts which Renderers and Windows can use
- 2. Move glX context for X11 to a context class (Depends on 1.)
- 3. Implement image loading, attempt build own or use stb? stb is good but implement self is fun
    - Should it be cached? resource managers?
- 3. Implement textures/materials for models
- 4. Continue support on wavefront obj format
